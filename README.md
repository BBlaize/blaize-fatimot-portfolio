# [Project 1:PetMind Implementation Strategies](https://medium.com/@bolanleblaize/data-analyst-associate-project-7040cdf55211)
This is a project I did in order to earn my Data Analyst Associate Certificate from DataCamp. I worked on a Pet Company dataset.
PetMind is a retailer of products for pets. They are based in the United States. PetMind sells products that are a mix of luxury items and everyday items.
### The objectives of the company was to:
- increase sales by selling more everyday products repeatedly. They have been testing this approach for the last year.
- get a report on how repeat purchases impact sales.


The analysis and visualization of this project were done with Excel and Python.

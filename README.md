# [Project 1:PetMind Implementation Strategies](https://medium.com/@bolanleblaize/data-analyst-associate-project-7040cdf55211)
This is a project I did in order to earn my Data Analyst Associate Certificate from DataCamp. I worked on a Pet Company dataset.
PetMind is a retailer of products for pets. They are based in the United States. PetMind sells products that are a mix of luxury items and everyday items.
### The objectives of the company was to:
- increase sales by selling more everyday products repeatedly. They have been testing this approach for the last year.
- get a report on how repeat purchases impact sales.
The analysis and visualization of this project were done with Excel and Python, and PowerBi.
The report of this project was done with Microsoft PowerPoint.

# Project 2:Stroke Prediction Analysis
A Stroke Center aims to identify individuals at higher risk of having a stroke in order to enhance awareness campaigns. 
For this analysis, I utilized a dataset in CSV format, which I imported into Power BI. After transforming the data, I performed data manipulation to ensure it was thoroughly cleaned.
I created two conditional columns for further insights. The first column was used to create an age group such as If age is less than or equal to 2 then “Child”, etc.

The Second conditional column was used to create BMI interpretation, if BMI is less than 18.5 then “Underweight”.

The analysis and visualization of this project were done with PowerBi.
The report of this project was done with Microsoft PowerPoint.

### Key Insights:
- The total number of survey participants, amounted to 5,110, and 249 participants actually have stroke.
- The analysis indicates that Elderly individuals, who are above the age of 60 are more likely to experience a stroke.
- Additionally, those classified as Obese or Overweight are at a greater risk of developing stroke compared to those with a healthy weight.
This data-driven approach can help inform targeted awareness initiatives for stroke prevention.
